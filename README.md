# Retrix
Back in June I was going to make a successor to Purplestore. Built off of [stuffed18's iPA archive](https://stuffed18.github.io/ipa-archive-updated/), I tried making it look nicer and adding support for on-device installation, with plans to make it into a full-fledged app store. However, two or so weeks into making it, I abandoned it due to lack of motivation/interest.

The code is in a pretty bad state right now, but I wanted to upload it here just in case anyone else wanted to tinker around with it :p
